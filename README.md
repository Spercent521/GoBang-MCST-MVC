# GoBang-MCTS-MVC

This project implements the classic Gobang game using the Qt framework, featuring an MVC architecture with modular design. The AI opponent employs an optimized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm enhanced with heuristic strategies for intelligent decision-making.

# Key Notes

- Ready-to-run executable: `gobang-v1.exe` is available in release package
- Current AI limitations: The MCTS implementation remains basic due to computational constraints and skill limitations - it's still a rather naive player, though the core framework is established
- Code quality note: Contains some redundant code sections needing cleanup
